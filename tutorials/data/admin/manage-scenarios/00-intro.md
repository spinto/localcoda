Welcome to the Scenario Manager app

This app lets you add/remove/manage scenarios/tutorias in your area.

If you know what you are doing, you can just use this playground, and shut it off once you have done with the `poweroff`{{exec}} command. If it is the first time you are using it, click start and follow the guide on how to add new scenarios
