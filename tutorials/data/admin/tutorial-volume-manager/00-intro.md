Welcome to the Tutorials Volume Manager app

This app lets you add/remove tutorials from your application.

If you know what you are doing, you can just use this playground, and shut it off once you have done with the `poweroff`{{cxec}} command. If it is the first time you are using it, click start and follow the guide on how to add new tutorials
